          <b>1. Como e porquê o UltraDentino funciona?</b>
        </FAQPTitle>
        <FAQP>
          We ve always been told that “bad” bacteria are to blame for all dental
          diseases but, upon a closer look, scientists have realized that
          imbalance in the oral health is caused by the lack of good bacteria.
          The population of good bacteria can be harmed by common dental
          products that might contain toxic ingredients. This explains why teeth
          can thrive for thousands of years outside of the mouth, while in our
          mouth they get ruined by plain chocolate. In order to support the
          health of your teeth and gums, you need to repopulate your mouth with
          good bacteria and provide a healthy environment for the strains to
          grow in. ProDentim is a doctor-formulated mix that gathers 5
          scientifically proven, potent strains, combining a total of 3.5
          Billion good bacteria into one revolutionary dissolvable candy. This
          probiotic candy also targets your respiratory system, supporting your
          body to stay free from allergies, while also promoting restful sleep
          and good digestion.

        <FAQPTitle>2. Are there any side effects?</FAQPTitle>
        <FAQP>
          ProDentim has been designed for all ages and medical conditions. All
          of the ingredients inside of ProDentim have been generally considered
          to be safe, and are constantly tested for purity and to ensure against
          toxins and contaminants. Moreover, ProDentim is manufactured in an
          FDA-approved facility, under sterile, strict and precise standards. As
          always, if you currently have a medical condition or you’re taking
          other prescription medication, we advise you to show a bottle of
          ProDentim to your doctor before you take it, just to put your mind at
          ease.

        <FAQPTitle>3. When and how should I take ProDentim?</FAQPTitle>
        <FAQP>
          We recommend you slowly chew a tablet every morning to support the
          health of your entire body, gums and teeth.

          4. What if it doesn’t work for me? Can you tell me about the guarantee
          again?
        </FAQPTitle>
        <FAQP>
          The more results we see, the stronger we believe ProDentim has the
          power to transform lives. It’s true, though, that nothing works for
          100% of the people who try it as each body works in its own way.
          That’s why every bottle of ProDentim comes with an ironclad 60-day
          money back guarantee. If, for any reason, you aren’t fully satisfied
          with the results, you can just return what you haven't used for a
          full, no question asked refund.
        </FAQP>
